# Overview
This is a simple Android application built as a practice project to explore Test-Driven Development (TDD) using JUnit4. The project follows the TDD process, specifically the Red, Green, Refactor method, which is widely recognized as an effective and efficient approach to TDD.

## What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development, or TDD for short, is a software development process that emphasizes writing test cases before developing the actual software. This approach ensures that the requirements are clearly defined and that the software behaves as expected.

### The Red, Green, Refactor Process:
Red: Write a failing test case based on the requirements.
Green: Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.
Refactor: Clean up the code, ensuring it meets the required standards while keeping all tests green.
